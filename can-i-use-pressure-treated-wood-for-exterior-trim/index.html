This means posts in contact or buried underground obviously, but it also includes any lumber touching concrete or masonry since it�s porous and wicks water like a sponge..</p>

<p>exterior What is this rotting wood �ledge� around my, But treated wood is also associated with health issues. It needs room for expansion and contraction or it will ripple, buckle, or bulge.

<p>Mike’s Guys Replacing Rotten Exterior Trim &amp; Handrails, Yes, you can use it on exterior projects. Treated wood lasts a lifetime when properly maintained.
