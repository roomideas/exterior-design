<p>Alternate Interior Angles Theorem Equation Review Home Decor, Alternate exterior angles are those angles that have different vertices, they lie on the alternate sides of the transversal and are exterior to the lines. Start studying alternate interior, exterior, and consecutive interior angles. Suppose a and b are two parallel lines and l is the transversal which intersects a and b at point p and q. You would be.</p>

<p>Same Side Interior Angles Congruent Or Supplementary, When two lines are crossed by another line (the transversal), a pair of angles. Alternate interior angles are a pair of angles on the inner side of each of those two lines but on opposite sides of the transversal.

<p>Alternate Interior Angles Theorem Review Home Decor, When two lines are crossed by another line (the transversal), a pair of angles. When a transversal intersects two parallel lines, the alternate exterior angles formed are always equal. Alternate angle definition if a straight line intersects two or more parallel lines, then it is called a transversal line. Alternate angles are shaped by the two parallel lines crossed by.</p>
