<p>Alternate Interior Angles / Alternate interior &amp; exterior, Alternate interior angles are congruent same side interior angles (consecutive interior angles) sum to 180 degrees and knowing how to identify these angle pair relationships is crucial for proving two lines are parallel, as study.com accurately states. Transversal line two separate straight lines, can both be crossed by a third line, called a transversal line. When a transversal intersects two.</p>

<p>Alternate Interior Angles Are Equal Review Home Decor, Interior angles are created in the space inside the parallel lines.
