Depending on the nature of the lines, the angles will have some characteristics. You would be outside, at the exterior, of the parallel lines. Alternate exterior angles are formed by a transversal intersecting two parallel lines. When two lines are crossed by a transversal, the angle pair on the outside of the lines is the alternate exterior angle. Noun 0 0 two angles formed on. When two lines are crossed by another line (the transversal), a pair of angles • on the outer side of those two lines • but on opposite sides of the transversal are called alternate exterior angles.
