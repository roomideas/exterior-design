<p>Properties of triangles, The exterior angle of a regular polygon is formed by extending one side of the polygon and then the angle between that extension and the adjacent side is measured. What is the exterior angle property? 1 when any side of the triangle is produced, the side produced and the other side from the same vertex forms a pair of angles..</p>

<p>Theorem 6.8 Exterior angle is equal to sum interior, Exterior angle of a triangle an exterior angle of a triangle is formed when one side of a triangle is extended. The sum of these angles is 180°. Those two rays represent the angle’s sides. 2 sum of three angles of the triangle is 180°. If the side (bc) of a triangle (abc) is produced to form ray (bd,) then.</p>
