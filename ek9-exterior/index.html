Jdm ek9 civic type r rear glass hatch. Hello all, i am wondering if someone with a civic type r can take detailed interior and exterior pictures, i am doing a ctr conversion on my hatchback and im only halfway done, but i do not know what the inside looks like, besides the fact that it has red carpet, door panels and seats, but that is as far as my knowledge goes, so if anyone is willing to take pictures and email. Excel charcoal = type f aka nh178l. Black = type d aka nh167l. Ive got a ek cxi. The exterior of andy’s ek9 is a shining example of how adding just the right, carefully curated parts can accentuate the classic jdm hot hatch.
