<p>PPT Classify the triangle by the angles and the sides, We know that, the exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of its opposite interior angles. 2x = 105° x = 52.5° x = 52½. So here the sum of 2 given angles must measure up to 110°. Properties of exterior angles of a triangle. Every triangle has six exterior angles (two at each vertex are equal.</p>
