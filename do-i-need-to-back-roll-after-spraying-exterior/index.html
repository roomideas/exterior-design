<p>Introducing MONSTALINER UV Permanent DIY Roll On Bed Liner, Look at it from an angle. Especially when spraying exterior siding. Similarly, you may ask, is it better to spray or roll a ceiling?

<p>Introducing MONSTALINER UV Permanent DIY Roll On Bed Liner, Back brushing or brushing will not necessarily cause the coating to soak in more. With a brush or roller, work the paint into the cracks and crevices on the surface.
